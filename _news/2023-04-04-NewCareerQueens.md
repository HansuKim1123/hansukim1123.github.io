I have started a Postdoctoral Fellow position in the [Structural and Multidisciplinary Systems Design (SMSD) Group](https://ilyongkim.ca/) directed by Prof. [Il Yong Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9nbcizgAAAAJ) at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/) in Kingston, Canada. Good luck!
