Paper entitled "[Design of a metal additive manufactured aircraft seat leg using topology optimization and part decomposition](https://doi.org/10.1108/RPJ-11-2023-0400)" has been published in [Rapid Prototyping Journal](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/journal/rpj).

To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this study is the first paper to design an aircraft seat leg structure manufactured with metal additive manufacturing using a rigorous topology optimization approach. The resultant design reduces mass and part count compared to a reference design and is verified with respect to real-world aircraft certification requirements.
